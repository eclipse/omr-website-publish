This repository holds the source for the Eclipse OMR web site
hosted at the [Eclipse Foundation](https://www.eclipse.org/omr).

The files here are built by Jekyll into a static web site
hosted at that address. A Hudson job running on the Eclipse
OMR Hudson instance will automatically regenerate the
site when commits are merged in this repository.

We're just getting this repository set up, so we're a little
light on things like contribution guidelines at the moment.
If you have a question or concern please raise an issue.
